# Air-Conditioner-s-Efficiency-Monitoring-System-using-IoT

Air Conditioner's Efficiency Monitoring System using IoT is a project for my Final Year Project where the system's purposes are to monitor the efficiency (as the name suggest), and to alert the user in case there's any inefficient or abnormality in the value of the parameters being monitored.

The system is being monitored through Blynk IoT and developed in Arduino IDE.

Hardware required:
 - NodeMCU ESP8266
 - DHT11
 - Sharp's Optical Dust Sensor
